### Transformers used in the example transactions

## General notes

I'm thinking, whether it's needed to perform any checks on the so called transformations executed during swaps (`transformERC20`). And if yes, what's the smartest way to do it.

As per my observations, during swaps several transformations `FillQuoteTransformer` could be executed as well as transformation `PayTakerTransformer`.

> Transformations are trustless, but at this time they are permissioned so only 0x Labs can deploy new Transformers.

That means that we should be safe from malicious transformations, but we should be aware of the fact that the transformations could be changed by 0x Labs.

During swap execution the address of a transformer is calculated using 
```
address payable transformer = LibERC20Transformer.getDeployedAddress(
  transformerDeployer,
  transformation.deploymentNonce
)
```
where `transformerDeployer` comes from 0x contract storage and can't be manipulated, and `transformation.deploymentNonce` is a nonce of a transformer passed to the `transformERC20`.

With this in mind, I could only think of the following negative scenarios:
* manager/trader passes malicious transformation, but as it's not deployed by 0x Labs, it will fail because `transformerDeployer` won't be able to calculate the address of the transformer
* manager/trader passes additional valid transformations (with valid nonce and data), but I couldn't yet think of any negative impact of them by looking at [five transformers that are currently deployed and whitelisted](https://github.com/0xProject/protocol/blob/development/packages/contract-addresses/addresses.json#L224)

> The transaction will revert if a transformation fails; the inputTokenAmount cannot be transferred from the sender; or the minOutputTokenAmount is not transferred to the sender.

This is a quite encouraging statement which probably mitigates all doubts expressed above, but I'm not 100% sure. So integration tests could possibly help to check my assumptions.


## Notes on picking up the right transformer

Top level call `transformERC20` accepts param `transformations` which is an array of structs with the following fields: `deploymentNonce` and `data`. `deploymentNonce` is required to be able to calculate the address of the transformer contract like following:
```
address payable transformer = LibERC20Transformer.getDeployedAddress(
    transformerDeployer,
    transformation.deploymentNonce
);
```
`transformerDeployer` https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3a539ed6bd42de8fbaf3899fb490c792e153d647 has already deployed several versions of this or that transfomer. As far as I understood, latest version of `FillQuoteTransformer` has nonce 15 https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xd140adb61d4e3e3978d4f32ac6b92240ff6e3a6e#code. So, if we want to use this transformer, we should pass `deploymentNonce` equal to 15. However, if passed `deploymentNonce` is 6 (just an example), one of the previous versions of `FillQuoteTransformer` can be used. I couldn't find any limitations in the code to prevent previous versions of transformers to be used (because 6 is also a nonce of `FillQuoteTransformer`, can be checked via etherscan). Hence the concerns:
- how safe it is that previously deployed transformers can be used
- how to know what is the latest valid `deploymentNonce` of a transformer to make sure that the latest version is always used

If the above are resolved, then whitelisting of allowed transfomers can be implemented.
